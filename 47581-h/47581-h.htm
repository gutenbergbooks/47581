  SOME ANIMAL PROPENSITIES.</h2>

<div>
  <img class="drop-cap" src="images/initial_i.jpg" width="59" height="125"
    alt="" />
</div>
<p class="drop-cap">IT is not quite agreeable to contemplate
many of the shortcomings,
from a moral point of
view, of certain of the animal
creation, and even less to be
compelled to recognize the necessity
of them. Thievery in nature is widely
extended, and food is the excuse for it.
Civilization has made the practice of
the humanities possible among men,
but the lower animals will doubtless
remain, as they have ever been, wholly
subject to the instincts with which
nature originally endowed them.</p>

<p>Huber relates an anecdote of some
Hive-bees paying a visit to a nest of
Bumble-bees, placed in a box not far
from their hive, in order to steal or
beg the honey. The Hive-bees, after
pillaging, had taken almost entire
possession of the nest. Some Bumble-bees,
which remained, went out to
collect provisions, and bringing home
the surplus after they had supplied
their own immediate wants, the Hive-bees
followed them and did not quit
them until they had obtained the
fruit of their labors. They licked
them, presented to them their probosces,
surrounded them, and thus at
last persuaded them to part with the
contents of their "honey-bags." The
Bumble-bees did not seem to harm or
sting them, hence it would seem to
have been persuasion rather than force
that produced this instance of self-denial.
But it was systematic robbery,
and was persisted in until the Wasps
were attracted by the same cause,
when the Bumble-bees entirely forsook
the nest.</p>

<p>Birds, notwithstanding their attractiveness
in plumage and sweetness
in song, are many of them great
thieves. They are neither fair nor
generous towards each other. When
nest-building they will steal the
feathers out of the nests of other birds,
and frequently drive off other birds
from a feeding ground even when there
is abundance. This is especially true
of the Robin, who will peck and run
after and drive away birds much larger
than himself. In this respect the
Robin and Sparrow resemble each
other. Both will drive away a Blackbird
and carry away the worm it has
made great efforts to extract from the
soil.</p>

<p>Readers of Frank Buckland's delightful
books will remember his pet Rat,
which not infrequently terrified his
visitors at breakfast. He had made
a house for the pet just by the
side of the mantel-piece, and this was
approached by a kind of ladder, up
which the Rat had to climb when he
had ventured down to the floor. Some
kinds of fish the Rat particularly liked,
and was sure to come out if the savor
was strong. One day Mr. Buckland
turned his back to give the Rat a
chance of seizing the coveted morsel,
which he was not long in doing and in
running up the ladder with it; but he
had fixed it by the middle of the back,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[Pg 82]</a></span>
and the door of the entrance was too
narrow to admit of its being drawn in
thus. But the Rat was equal to the
emergency. In a moment he bethought
himself, laid the fish on the
small platform before the door, and
then entering his house he put out his
mouth, took the fish by the nose and
thus pulled it in and made a meal of it.</p>

<p>One of the most remarkable instances
of carrying on a career of theft came
under our own observation, says a
writer in <i>Cassell's Magazine</i>. A friend
in northeast Essex had a very fine
Aberdeenshire Terrier, a female, and a
very affectionate relationship sprang
up between this Dog and a Tom cat.
The Cat followed the Dog with the
utmost fondness, purring and running
against it, and would come and call at
the door for the Dog to come out.
Attention was first drawn to the pair
by this circumstance. One evening
we were visiting our friend and heard
the Cat about the door calling, and
some one said to our friend that the
cat was noisy. "He wants little Dell,"
said he&mdash;that being the Dog's name;
we looked incredulous. "Well, you
shall see," said he, and opening the
door he let the Terrier out. At once
the Cat bounded toward her, fawned
round her, and then, followed by the
Dog, ran about the lawn. But a
change came. Some kittens were
brought to the house, and the Terrier
got much attached to them and they
to her. The Tom cat became neglected,
and soon appeared to feel it. By and
by, to the surprise of every one, the
Tom somehow managed to get, and to
establish in the hedge of the garden,
two kittens, fiery, spitting little things,
and carried on no end of depredation
on their account. Chickens went; the
fur and remains of little Rabbits were
often found round the nest, and pieces
of meat disappeared from kitchen and
larder. This went on for some time,
when suddenly the Cat disappeared&mdash;had
been shot in a wood near by, by a
game-keeper, when hunting to provide
for these wild kittens, which were
allowed to live in the hedge, as they
kept down the Mice in the garden.
This may be said to be a case of
animal thieving for a loftier purpose
than generally obtains, mere demand
for food and other necessity.</p>

<p>That nature goes her own way is
illustrated by these anecdotes of birds
and animals, and by many others even
more strange and convincing. The
struggle for existence, like the brook,
goes on forever, and the survival, if
not of the fittest, at least of the
strongest, must continue to be the rule
of life, so long as the economical
problems of existence remain unsolved.
Man and beast must be fed.
"Manna," to some extent, will always
be provided by generous humanitarianism.
There will always be John
Howards. Occasionally a disinterested,
self-abnegating soul like that of John
Woolman will appear among us&mdash;doing
good from love; and, it may be,
men like Jonathan Chapman&mdash;Johnny
Appleseed, he was called from his
habit of planting apple seeds whereever
he went, as he distributed tracts
among the frontier settlers in the early
days of western history. He would
not harm even a Snake. His heart
was right, though his judgment was
little better than that of many modern
sentimentalists who cannot apparently
distinguish the innocuous from the
venemous.</p>

<p>It does seem that birds and animals
are warranted in committing every
act of vandalism that they are
accused of. They are unquestionably
entitled by every natural right to
everything of which they take
possession. The farmer has no moral
right to deny them a share in the product
of his fields and orchards; the
gardener is their debtor (at least of the
birds), and the government, which
benefits also from their industry, should
give them its protection.&mdash;C. C. M.</p>

<h2><a name="WATER_AND_ANIMALS" id="WATER_AND_ANIMALS"></a>WATER AND ANIMALS.</h2>

<div>
  <img class="drop-cap" src="images/initial_t.jpg" width="100" height="93"
    alt="" />
</div>
<p class="drop-cap">TO SHOW the importance of
water to animal life, we give
the opinions of several
travelers and scientific men
who have studied the question
thoroughly.</p>

<p>The Camel, with his pouch for storing
water, can go longer without
drink than other animals. He doesn't
do it from choice, any more than you
in a desert would prefer to drink the
water that you have carried with you,
if you might choose between that and
fresh spring water. Major A. G.
Leonard, an English transport officer,
claims that Camels "should be watered
every day, that they can not be trained
to do without water, and that, though
they can retain one and a half gallons
of water in the cells of the stomach,
four or five days' abstinence is as much
as they can stand, in heat and with
dry food, without permanent injury."</p>

<p>Another distinguished English
traveler, a Mr. Bryden, has observed
that the beasts and birds of the
deserts must have private stores of
water of which we know nothing. Mr.
Bryden, however, has seen the Sand-Grouse
of South America on their
flight to drink at a desert pool. "The
watering process is gone through with
perfect order and without overcrowding"&mdash;a
hint to young people who are
hungry and thirsty at their meals.
"From eight o'clock to close on ten
this wonderful flight continued; as
birds drank and departed, others were
constantly arriving to take their
places. I should judge that the average
time spent by each bird at and around
the water was half an hour."</p>

<p>To show the wonderful instinct
which animals possess for discovering
water an anecdote is told by a writer
in the <i>Spectator</i>, and the article is republished
in the <i>Living Age</i> of
February 5. The question of a supply
of good water for the Hague was under
discussion in Holland at the time of
building the North Sea Canal. Some
one insisted that the Hares, Rabbits,
and Partridges knew of a supply in the
sand hills, because they never came to
the wet "polders" to drink. At first
the idea excited laughter. Then one
of the local engineers suggested that the
sand hills should be carefully explored,
and now a long reservoir in the very
center of those hills fills with water
naturally and supplies the entire town.</p>

<p>All this goes to prove to our mind
that if Seals do not apparently drink,
if Cormorants and Penguins, Giraffes,
Snakes, and Reptiles seem to care
nothing for water, some of them do
eat wet or moist food, while the
Giraffe, for one, enjoys the juices of
the leaves of trees that have their
roots in the moisture. None of these
animals are our common, everyday
pets. If they were, it would cost us
nothing to put water at their disposal,
but that they never drink in their
native haunts "can not be proved until
the deserts have been explored and
the total absence of water confirmed."&mdash;<i>Ex.</i></p>

</div>
<p class="drop-cap">JUST how many species of Gulls
there are has not yet been
determined, but the habits
and locations of about twenty-six
species have been described. The
American Herring Gull is found
throughout North America, nesting
from Maine northward, and westward
throughout the interior on the large
inland waters, and occasionally on the
Pacific; south in the winter to Cuba
and lower California. This Gull is a
common bird throughout its range,
particularly coast-wise.</p>

<p>Col. Goss in his "Birds of Kansas,"
writes as follows of the Herring Gull:</p>

<p>"In the month of June, 1880, I
found the birds nesting in large communities
on the little island adjacent
to Grand Manan; many were nesting
in spruce tree tops from twenty to
forty feet from the ground. It was an
odd sight to see them on their nests
or perched upon a limb, chattering
and scolding as approached.</p>

<p>"In the trees I had no difficulty in
finding full sets of their eggs, as the
egg collectors rarely take the trouble
to climb, but on the rocks I was unable
to find an egg within reach, the
'eggers' going daily over the rocks.
I was told by several that they yearly
robbed the birds, taking, however, but
nine eggs from a nest, as they found
that whenever they took a greater
number, the birds so robbed would
forsake their nests, or, as they expressed
it, cease to lay, and that in
order to prevent an over-collection they
invariably drop near the nest a little
stone or pebble for every egg taken."</p>

<p>The young Gulls grow rapidly.
They do not leave their nesting
grounds until able to fly, though, half-grown
birds are sometimes seen on the
water that by fright or accident have
fallen. The nests are composed of
grass and moss. Some of them are
large and elaborately made, while
others are merely shallow depressions
with a slight lining. Three eggs are
usually laid, which vary from bluish-white
to a deep yellowish brown,
spotted and blotched with brown of
different shades. In many cases where
the Herring Gull has suffered persecution,
it has been known to depart from
its usual habit of nesting on the open
seashore.</p>

<p>It is a pleasure to watch a flock of
Gulls riding buoyantly upon the water.
They do not dive, as many suppose,
but only immerse the head and neck.
They are omnivorous and greedy
eaters; "scavengers of the beach, and
in the harbors to be seen boldly alighting
upon the masts and flying about
the vessels, picking up the refuse matter
as soon as it is cast overboard, and
often following the steamers from
thirty to forty miles from the land,
and sometimes much farther." They
are ever upon the alert, with a quick
eye that notices every floating object
or disturbance of the water, and as they
herald with screams the appearance of
the Herring or other small fishes that
often swim in schools at the surface of
the water, they prove an unerring pilot
to the fishermen who hastily follow
with their lines and nets, for they
know that beneath and following the
valuable catch in sight are the larger
fishes that are so intent upon taking
the little ones in out of the wet as
largely to forget their cunning, and
thus make their capture an easy one.</p>

<p>Very large flocks of Gulls, at times
appearing many hundreds, are seen on
Lake Michigan. We recently saw in
the vicinity of Milwaukee a flock of
what we considered to be many
thousands of these birds, flying swiftly,
mounting up, and falling, as if to
catch themselves, in wide circles, the
sun causing their wings and sides to
glisten like burnished silver.</p>

  USEFUL BIRDS OF PREY.</h2>

<div>
  <img class="drop-cap" src="images/initial_i.jpg" width="59" height="125"

</div>
<p class="drop-cap">IT is claimed that two hundred
millions of dollars that should
go to the farmer, the gardner,
and the fruit grower in the
United States are lost every
year by the ravages of insects&mdash;that is
to say, one-tenth of our agricultural
product is actually destroyed by them.
The Department of Agriculture has
made a thorough investigation of this
subject, and its conclusions are about
as stated. The ravages of the Gypsy
Moth in three counties in Massachusetts
for several years annually cost
the state $100,000. "Now, as rain is
the natural check to drought, so birds
are the natural check to insects, for
what are pests to the farmer are
necessities of life to the bird. It is
calculated that an average insectivorous
bird destroys 2,400 insects in
a year; and when it is remembered
that there are over 100,000 kinds of
insects in the United States, the majority
of which are injurious, and that
in some cases a single individual in a
year may become the progenitor of
several billion descendants, it is seen
how much good birds do ordinarily by
simple prevention." All of which has
reference chiefly to the indispensableness
of preventing by every possible
means the destruction of the birds
whose food largely consists of insects.</p>

<p>But many of our so-called birds of
prey, which have been thought to be
the enemies of the agriculturist and
have hence been ruthlessly destroyed,
are equally beneficial. Dr. Fisher, an
authority on the subject, in referring
to the injustice which has been done
to many of the best friends of the farm
and garden, says:</p>

<p>"The birds of prey, the majority of
which labor night and day to destroy
the enemies of the husbandman, are
persecuted unceasingly. This has
especially been the case with the Hawk
family, only three of the common inland
species being harmful. These
are the Goshawk, Cooper's Hawk, and
the Sharp-shinned Hawk, the first of
which is rare in the United States,
except in winter. Cooper's Hawk, or
the Chicken Hawk, is the most destructive,
especially to Doves. The
other Hawks are of great value, one
of which, the Marsh Hawk, being
regarded as perhaps more useful than
any other. It can be easily distinguished
by its white rump and its
habit of beating low over the meadows.
Meadow Mice, Rabbits, and Squirrels
are its favorite food. The Red-tailed
Hawk, or Hen Hawk, is another." It
does not deserve the name, for according
to Dr. Fisher, while fully sixty-six
per cent of its food consists of
injurious mammals, not more than
seven per cent consists of poultry, and
that it is probable that a large proportion
of the poultry and game captured
by it and the other Buzzard Hawks is
made up of old, diseased, or otherwise
disabled fowls, so preventing their
interbreeding with the sound stock
and hindering the spread of fatal epidemics.
It eats Ground Squirrels,
Rabbits, Mice, and Rats.</p>

<p>The Red-shouldered Hawk, whose
picture we present to our readers, is as
useful as it is beautiful, in fact ninety
per cent of its food is composed of
injurious mammals and insects.</p>

<p>The Sparrow Hawk (See <span class="sc">Birds</span>, vol.
3, p. 107) is another useful member of
this family. In the warm months
Grasshoppers, Crickets, and other insects
compose its food, and Mice during
the rest of the year.</p>

<p>Swainson's Hawk is said to be the
great Grasshopper destroyer of the
west, and it is estimated that in a
month three hundred of these birds
save sixty tons of produce that the
Grasshopper would destroy.</p>

</div>
<p class="drop-cap">ON ACCOUNT of the value of
its skin, this interesting
animal is much sought after
by those who take pride in
their skill in securing it. It
is commonly known by its abbreviated
name of Coon, and as it is of frequent
occurrence throughout the United
States, every country boy is more or
less acquainted with its habits. As an
article of food there is much diversity
of opinion respecting its merits. It is
hunted by some for the sport alone,
which is doubtless to be lamented, and
by others who enjoy also the pleasure
of a palatable stew. As a pet it is also
much prized.</p>

<p>The food of the Raccoon consists in
the main of small animals and insects.
The succulent Oyster also is a favorite
article of its diet. It bites off the
hinge of the Oyster and scrapes out the
animal in fragments with its paws.
Like the Squirrel when eating a nut,
the Raccoon usually holds its food
between its fore paws pressed together
and sits upon its hind quarters when
it eats. Poultry is also enjoyed by it,
and it is said to be as destructive in
the farm yard as the Fox, as it only
devours the heads of the fowl.</p>

<p>When taken young the Coon is
easily tamed, but often becomes blind
soon after its capture. This is believed
to be produced by the sensitiveness of
its eyes, which are intended only to
be used by night. As it is frequently
awakened by day it suffers so much
from the glare of light that its eyes
gradually lose their vision. If it must
be confined at all it should be in a
darkened place. In zoological gardens
we have frequently seen several of
these animals exposed to the glaring
sunlight, the result of ignorance or
cruelty, or both.</p>

<p>Unlike the Fox, the Raccoon is at
home in a tree, which is the usual
refuge when danger is near, and not
being very swift of foot, it is well that
it possesses this climbing ability. According
to Hallock, the Coons' abode
is generally in a hollow tree, oak or
chestnut, and when the "juvenile farmer's
son comes across a <i>Coon tree</i>, he
is not long in making known his discovery
to friends and neighbors, who
forthwith assemble at the spot to
secure it." The "sport" is in no sense
agreeable from a humane point of
view, and we trust it will cease to be
regarded as such by those who indulge
in it. "The Raccoon makes a heroic
struggle and often puts many of his
assailants <i>hors de combat</i> for many a
day, his jaws being strong and his
claws sharp."</p>

<p>The young ones are generally from
four to eight, pretty little creatures at
first and about as large as half-grown
Rats. They are very playful, soon
become docile and tame, but at the
first chance will wander off to the
woods and not return. The Coon is a
night animal and never travels by day;
sometimes it is said, being caught at
morning far from its tree and being
unable to return thither, it will spend
the hours of daylight snugly coiled up
among the thickest foliage of some
lofty tree-top. It is adroit in its attempts
to baffle Dogs, and will often
enter a brook and travel for some distance
in the water, thus puzzling and
delaying its pursuers.</p>

<p>A good sized Raccoon will weigh
from fifteen to twenty pounds.</p>

<p>The curiosity of the Raccoon is one
of its most interesting characteristics.
It will search every place of possible
concealment for food, examine critically
any object of interest, will rifle
a pocket, stand upright and watch
every motion of man or animal, and
indeed show a marked desire for all
sorts of knowledge. Raccoons are
apparently happy in captivity when
properly cared for by their keepers.</p>

<h2><a name="WILD_BIRDS_IN_LONDON" id="WILD_BIRDS_IN_LONDON"></a>
  WILD BIRDS IN LONDON.</h2>

<p class="bq ac">Their Number and Variety is Increasing Instead of Diminishing.</p>

<div>
  <img class="drop-cap" src="images/initial_w.jpg" width="100" height="68"
    alt="" />
</div>
<p class="drop-cap">WHETHER in consequence
of the effective working
of the Wild Birds' Charter
or of other unknown
causes, there can be no doubt in the
minds of observant lovers of our
feathered friends that of late years
there has been a great and gratifying
increase in their numbers in and
around London, especially so, of course,
in the vicinity of the beautiful open
spaces which do such beneficent work
silently in this province of houses.
But even in long, unlovely streets, far
removed from the rich greenery of the
parks, the shabby parallelograms, by
courtesy styled gardens, are becoming
more and more frequently visited by
such pretty shy songsters as Linnets,
Blackbirds, Thrushes, and Finches,
who, though all too often falling
victims to the predatory Cat, find
abundant food in these cramped
enclosures. Naturally some suburbs
are more favored than others in this
respect, notably Dulwich, which,
though fast losing its beautiful
character under the ruthless grip of
the builder, still retains some delightful
nooks where one may occasionally
hear the Nightingale's lovely song in
its season.</p>

<p>But the most noticable additions to
the bird population of London have
been among the Starlings. Their
quaint gabble and peculiar minor
whistle may now be heard in the most
unexpected localities. Even the
towering mansions which have replaced
so many of the slums of Westminster
find favor in their eyes, for
among the thick clustering chimneys
which crown these great buildings
their slovenly nests may be found in
large numbers. In some districts they
are so numerous that the irrepressible
Sparrow, true London gamin that he
is, finds himself in considerable danger
of being crowded out. This is perhaps
most evident on the sequestered lawns
of some of the inns of the court, Gray's
Inn Square, for instance, where hundreds
of Starlings at a time may now
be observed busily trotting about the
greensward searching for food. Several
long streets come to mind where not a
house is without its pair or more of
Starlings, who continue faithful to
their chosen roofs, and whose descendants
settle near as they grow up, well
content with their surroundings.
House Martins, too, in spite of
repeated efforts on the part of irritated
landlords to drive them away by
destroying their nests on account of
the disfigurement to the front of the
dwelling, persist in returning year
after year and rebuilding their ingenious
little mud cells under the eaves of
the most modern suburban villas
or terrace houses.&mdash;<i>Pall Mall Gazette.</i></p>

<p class="drop-cap">THE Pigmy Antelopes present
examples of singular members
of the family, in that they are
of exceedingly diminutive
size, the smallest being no larger than
a large Rat, dainty creatures indeed.
The Pigmy is an inhabitant of South
Africa, and its habits are said to be
quite similar to those of its brother of
the western portion of North America.</p>

<p>The Antelope is a very wary animal,
but the sentiment of curiosity is
implanted so strongly in its nature
that it often leads it to reconnoitre too
closely some object which it cannot
clearly make out, and its investigations
are pursued until "the dire answer to
all inquiries is given by the sharp
'spang' of the rifle and the answering
'spat' as the ball strikes the beautiful
creatures flank." The Pigmy Antelope
is not hunted, however, as is its
larger congener, and may be considered
rather as a diminutive curiosity
of Natures' delicate workmanship than
as the legitimate prey of man.</p>

<h2><a name="BIRDS_OF_ALASKA" id="BIRDS_OF_ALASKA"></a>BIRDS OF ALASKA.</h2>


<p>No sooner had the twilight settled
over the island than new bird voices
called from the hills about us. The
birds of the day were at rest, and their
place was filled with the night denizens
of the island. They came from the
dark recesses of the forests, first single
stragglers, increased by midnight to a
stream of eager birds, passing to and
fro from the sea. Many, attracted by
the glow of the burning logs, altered
their course and circled about the fire
a few times and then sped on. From
their notes we identified the principal
night prowlers as the Cassin's Auklet,
Rhinoceros Auk, Murrelet, and varieties
of Petrel. All through the night our
slumbers were frequently disturbed by
birds alighting on the sides of the tent,
slipping down with great scratching
into the grass below, where our
excited Dog took a hand in the
matter, daylight often finding our
tent strewn with birds he had
captured during the night. When he
found time to sleep I do not know.
He was after birds the entire twenty-four
hours.</p>

<p>In climbing over the hills of the
island we discovered the retreats of
these night birds, the soil everywhere
through the deep wood being fairly
honeycombed with their nesting
burrows. The larger tunnels of the
Rhinoceros Auks were, as a rule, on
the slopes of the hill, while the little
burrows of the Cassin's Auklet were
on top in the flat places. We opened
many of their queer abodes that ran
back with many turns to a distance of
ten feet or more. One or both birds
were invariably found at the end,
covering their single egg, for this
species, like many other sea birds,
divide the duties of incubation, both
sexes doing an equal share, relieving
each other at night.</p>

<p>The Puffins nested in burrows also,
but lower down&mdash;often just above the
surf. One must be very careful,
indeed, how he thrusts his hand into
their dark dens, for should the old
bird chance to be at home, its vise-like
bill can inflict a very painful wound.
The rookeries of the Murres and
Cormorants were on the sides of steep
cliffs overhanging the sea. Looking
down from above, hundreds of eggs
could be seen, gathered along the
narrow shelves and chinks in the
rocks, but accessible only by means of
a rope from the top.&mdash;<i>Outing.</i></p>

<h2><a name="THE_RED-SHOULDERED_HAWK" id="THE_RED-SHOULDERED_HAWK"></a>
  THE RED-SHOULDERED HAWK.</h2>

<p>You have heard of me before.
I am the Hawk whose cry Mr.
Blue Jay imitated, as you will
remember, in the story "The
New Tenants," published in
Birds.</p>

<p><i>Kee-oe</i>, <i>kee-oe</i>, <i>kee-oe</i>, that is my
cry, very loud and plaintive;
they say I am a very noisy bird;
perhaps that is the reason why
Mr. Blue Jay imitates me more
than he does other Hawks.</p>

<p>I am called Chicken Hawk,
and Hen Hawk, also, though I
don't deserve either of those
names. There are members of
our family, and oh, what a lot of
us there are&mdash;as numerous as
the Woodpeckers&mdash;who do drop
down into the barnyards and
right before the farmer's eyes
carry off a Chicken. Red
Squirrels, to my notion, are more
appetizing than Chickens; so are
Mice, Frogs, Centipedes, Snakes,
and Worms. A bird once in a
while I like for variety, and between
you and me, if I am hungry,
I pick up a chicken now
and then, that has strayed outside
the barnyard. But only
<i>occasionally</i>, remember, so that I
don't deserve the name of
Chicken Hawk at all, do I?</p>

<p>Wooded swamps, groves
inhabited by Squirrels, and
patches of low timber are the
places in which we make our
homes. Sometimes we use an
old crow's nest instead of building
one; we retouch it a little
and put in a soft lining of
feathers which my mate plucks
from her breast. When we
build a new nest, it is made of
husks, moss, and strips of bark,
lined as the building progresses
with my mate's feathers. Young
lady Red-shouldered Hawks lay
three and sometimes four eggs,
but the old lady birds lay only
two.</p>

<p>Somehow Mr. Blue Jay never
sees a Hawk without giving the
alarm, and on he rushes to attack
us, backed up by other Jays
who never fail to go to his
assistance. They often assemble
in great numbers and actually
succeed in driving us out
of the neighborhood. Not that
we are afraid of them, oh no!
We know them to be great
cowards, as well as the crows,
who harass us also, and only
have to turn on our foes to put
them to rout. Sometimes we do
turn, and seizing a Blue Jay,
sail off with him to the nearest
covert; or in mid air strike a
Crow who persistently follows
us. But as a general thing we
simply ignore our little assailants,
and just fly off to avoid
them.</p>

<p class="drop-cap">THE Hawk family is an interesting
one and many of them
are beautiful. The Red-shouldered
Hawk is one of
the finest specimens of these birds, as
well as one of the most useful. Of
late years the farmer has come to know
it as his friend rather than his enemy,
as formerly. It inhabits the woodlands
where it feeds chiefly upon
Squirrels, Rabbits, Mice, Moles, and
Lizards. It occasionally drops down
on an unlucky Duck or Bob White,
though it is not quick enough to catch
the smaller birds. It is said to be
destructive to domestic fowls raised in
or near the timber, but does not appear
to search for food far away from its
natural haunts. As it is a very noisy
bird, the birds which it might destroy
are warned of its approach, and thus
protect themselves.</p>

<p>During the early nesting season its
loud, harsh <i>kee-oe</i> is heard from the
perch and while in the air, often keeping
up the cry for a long time without
intermission. Col. Goss says that he
collected at Neosho Falls, Kansas, for
several successive years a set of the
eggs of this species from a nest in the
forks of a medium sized oak. In
about nine days after each robbery the
birds would commence laying again,
and he allowed them to hatch and
rear their young. One winter during
his absence the tree was cut down,
but this did not discourage the birds,
or cause them to forsake the place, for
on approach of spring he found them
building a nest not over ten rods from
the old one, but this time in a large
sycamore beyond reach. This seemed
to him to indicate that they become
greatly attached to the grounds selected
for a home, which they vigilantly
guard, not permitting a bird of prey to
come within their limits.</p>

<p>This species is one of the commonest
in the United States, being especially
abundant in the winter, from which it
receives the name of Winter Falcon.
The name of Chicken Hawk is often
applied to it, though it does not deserve
the name, its diet being of a more
humble kind.</p>

<p>The eggs are usually deposited in
April or May in numbers of three or
four&mdash;sometimes only two. The
ground color is bluish, yellowish-white
or brownish, spotted, blotched and
dotted irregularly with many shades
of reddish brown. Some of them are
strikingly beautiful. According to
Davie, to describe all the shades of reds
and browns which comprise the variation
would be an almost endless task,
and a large series like this must be
seen in order to appreciate how much
the eggs of this species vary.</p>

<p>The flight of the Red-shouldered
Hawk is slow, but steady and strong
with a regular beat of the wings.
They take delight in sailing in the
air, where they float lightly and with
scarcely a notable motion of the wings,
often circling to a great height. During
the insect season, while thus sailing,
they often fill their craws with
grass-hoppers, that, during the after
part of the day, also enjoy an air sail.</p>

<h2><a name="THE_DOVES_OF_VENICE" id="THE_DOVES_OF_VENICE"></a>THE DOVES OF VENICE.</h2>

<div>
  <img class="drop-cap" src="images/initial_v.jpg" width="100" height="91"
    alt="" />
</div>
<p class="drop-cap">VENICE, the pride of Italy of
old, aside from its other
numerous curiosities and antiquities,
has one which is a
novelty indeed. Its Doves on the San
Marco Place are a source of wonder
and amusement to every lover of animal
life. Their most striking peculiarity
is that they fear no mortal man,
be he stranger or not. They come in
countless numbers, and, when not
perched on the far-famed bell tower,
are found on the flags of San Marco
Square. They are often misnamed
Pigeons, but as a matter of fact they
are Doves of the highest order. They
differ, however, from our wild Doves
in that they are fully three times as
large, and twice as large as our best
domestic Pigeon. Their plumage is
of a soft mouse color relieved by pure
white, and occasionally one of pure
white is found, but these are rare.
Hold out to them a handful of crumbs
and without fear they will come, perch
on your hand or shoulder and eat with
thankful coos. To strangers this is
indeed a pleasing sight, and demonstrates
the lack of fear of animals when
they are treated humanely, for none
would dare to injure the doves of San
Marco. He would probably forfeit his
life were he to injure one intentionally.
And what beggars these Doves of San
Marco are! They will crowd around,
and push and coo with their soft soothing
voices, until you can withstand
them no longer, and invest a few
centimes in bread for their benefit.
Their bread, by the way, is sold by an
Italian, who must certainly be in collusion
with the Doves, for whenever
a stranger makes his appearance, both
Doves and bread vender are at hand
to beg.</p>

<p>The most remarkable fact in connection
with these Doves is that they
will collect in no other place in large
numbers than San Marco Square, and
in particular at the vestibule of San
Marco Church. True, they are found
perched on buildings throughout the
entire city, and occasionally we will
find a few in various streets picking
refuse, but they never appear in great
numbers outside of San Marco Square.
The ancient bell tower, which is situated
on the west side of the place, is
a favorite roosting place for them, and
on this perch they patiently wait for a
foreigner, and proceed to bleed him
after approved Italian fashion.</p>

<p>There are several legends connected
with the Doves of Venice, each of
which attempts to explain the peculiar
veneration of the Venetian and the
extreme liberty allowed these harbingers
of peace. The one which
struck me as being the most appropriate
is as follows:</p>

<p>Centuries ago Venice was a free
city, having her own government,
navy, and army, and in a manner was
considered quite a power on land and
sea. The city was ruled by a Senate
consisting of ten men, who were called
Doges, who had absolute power, which
they used very often in a despotic and
cruel manner, especially where political
prisoners were concerned. On
account of the riches the city contained,
and also its values as a port,
Venice was coveted by Italy and neighboring
nations, and, as a consequence,
was often called upon to defend itself
with rather indifferent success. In
fact, Venice was conquered so often,
first by one and then another, that
Venetians were seldom certain of how
they stood. They knew not whether
they were slave or victor. It was
during one of these sieges that the incident
of the Doves occurred. The city
had been besieged for a long time by
Italians, and matters were coming to
such a pass that a surrender was absolutely
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[Pg 101]</a></span>
necessary on account of lack of
food. In fact, the Doges had issued a
decree that on the morrow the city
should surrender unconditionally.</p>

<p>All was gloom and sorrow, and the
populace stood around in groups on
the San Marco discussing the situation
and bewailing their fate, when lo! in
the eastern sky there appeared a dense
cloud rushing upon the city with the
speed of the wind. At first consternation
reigned supreme, and men asked
each other: "What new calamity is
this?" As the cloud swiftly approached
it was seen to be a vast number of
Doves, which, after hovering over the
San Marco Place for a moment, gracefully
settled down upon the flagstones
and approached the men without fear.
Then there arose a queer cry, "The
Doves! The Doves of San Marco!" It
appears that some years before this a
sage had predicted stormy times for
Venice, with much suffering and strife,
but, when all seemed lost, there would
appear a multitude of Doves, who
would bring Venice peace and happiness.
And so it came to pass that the
next day, instead of attacking, the
besiegers left, and Venice was free
again. The prophet also stated that,
so long as the Doves remained at Venice
prosperity would reign supreme,
but that there would come a day when
the Doves would leave just as they had
come, and Venice would pass into
oblivion. That is why Venetians take
such good care of their Doves.</p>

<p>You will not find this legend in any
history, but I give it just as it was
told me by a guide, who seemed well
versed in hair-raising legends. Possibly
they were manufactured to order
by this energetic gentleman, but they
sounded well nevertheless. Even to
this day the old men of Venice fear
that some morning they will awake
and find their Doves gone.</p>

<p>There in the shadow of the famous
bell-tower, with the stately San Marco
church on one side and the palace of
the cruel and murderous Doges on the
other, we daily find our pretty Doves
coaxing for bread. Often you will
find them peering down into the dark
passage-way in the palace, which leads
to the dungeons underneath the Grand
Canal. What a boon a sight of these
messengers of peace would have been
to the doomed inmates of these murder-reeking
caves. But happily they
are now deserted, and are used only as
a source of revenue, which is paid by
the inquisitive tourist.</p>

<p>Venice still remains as of old. She
never changes, and the Doves of San
Marco will still remain. May we hope,
with the sages of Venice, that they
may remain forever.&mdash;<i>Lebert, in Cincinnati
Commercial Gazette.</i></p>

</div>
<p class="drop-cap">IT may appear strange, if not altogether
inappropriate to the season,
that "the fair fragile things
which are the resurrection of
the ugly, creeping caterpillars"
should be almost as numerous in October
as in the balmy month of July.
Yet it is true, and early October, in
some parts of the country, is said to be
perhaps the best time of the year for
the investigating student and observer
of Butterflies. While not quite so
numerous, perhaps, many of the species
are in more perfect condition, and the
variety is still intact. Many of them
come and remain until frost, and the
largest Butterfly we have, the Archippus,
does not appear until the middle
of July, but after that is constantly
with us, floating and circling on the
wing, until October. How these delicate
creatures can endure even the
chill of autumn days is one of the
mysteries.</p>

<p>Very curious and interesting are the
Skippers, says <i>Current Literature</i>.
They are very small insects, but their
bodies are robust, and they fly with
great rapidity, not moving in graceful,
wavy lines as the true Butterflies do,
but skipping about with sudden, jerky
motions. Their flight is very short, and
almost always near the ground. They
can never be mistaken, as their peculiar
motion renders their identification
easy. They are seen at their best in
August and September. All June and
July Butterflies are August and September
Butterflies, not so numerous
in some instances, perhaps, but still
plentiful, and vying with the rich
hues of the changing autumnal foliage.</p>

<p>The "little wood brownies," or
Quakers, are exceedingly interesting.
Their colors are not brilliant, but
plain, and they seek the quiet and
retirement of the woods, where they
flit about in graceful circles over the
shady beds of ferns and woodland
grasses.</p>

<p>Many varieties of the Vanessa are
often seen flying about in May, but
they are far more numerous and perfect
in July, August, and September.
A beautiful Azure-blue Butterfly, when
it is fluttering over flowers in the sunshine,
looks like a tiny speck of bright
blue satin. Several other small Butterflies
which appear at the same time
are readily distinguished by the peculiar
manner in which their hind wings
are tailed. Their color is a dull brown
of various shades, marked in some of
the varieties with specks of white or
blue.</p>

<p>"Their presence in the gardens and
meadows," says a recent writer, "and
in the fields and along the river-banks,
adds another element of gladness which
we are quick to recognize, and even
the plodding wayfarer who has not the
honor of a single intimate acquaintance
among them might, perhaps, be
the first to miss their circlings about
his path. As roses belong to June,
and chrysanthemums to November, so
Butterflies seem to be a joyous part of
July. It is their gala-day, and they
are everywhere, darting and circling
and sailing, dropping to investigate
flowers and overripe fruit, and
rising on buoyant wings high into the
upper air, bright, joyous, airy, ephemeral.
But July can only claim the
larger part of their allegiance, for they
are wanderers into all the other
months, and even occasionally brave
the winter with torn and faded wings."</p>

<h2><a name="THE_FOX" id="THE_FOX"></a>THE FOX.</h2>


<p>"A sly dog."</p>

<p>Somehow people always say
that when they see a Fox. I'd
rather they would call me that
than stupid, however. Do I
look stupid in my picture?</p>

<p>"Look pleasant," said the man
when taking my photograph for
Birds, and I flatter myself I did&mdash;and
intelligent, too. Look at
my brainy head, my delicate
ears&mdash;broad below to catch every
sound, and tapering so sharply
to a point that they can shape
themselves to every wave of
sound. Note the crafty calculation
and foresight of my low,
flat brow, the resolute purpose
of my pointed nose; my eye deep
set&mdash;like a robber's&mdash;my thin
cynical lips, and mouth open
from ear to ear. You couldn't
find a better looking Fox if you
searched the world over.</p>

<p>I can leap, crawl, run, and
swim, and walk so noiselessly
that even the dead leaves won't
rustle under my feet. It takes
a deal of cunning for a Fox to
get along in this world, I can
tell you. I'd go hungry if I
didn't plan and observe the
habits of other creatures. For
instance: I love Fish. When I
want one for my supper off I
trot to the nearest stream, and
standing very quiet, watch till I
spy a nice, plump trout in the
clear water. A leap, a snap, and
it is all over with Mr. Trout.</p>

<p>Another time I feel as though
I'd like a crawfish. I see one
snoozing by his hole near the
water's edge. I drop my fine,
bushy tail into the water and
tickle him on the ear. That
makes him furious&mdash;nobody
likes to be wakened from a nap
that way&mdash;and out he darts at
the tail; snap go my jaws, and
Mr. Crawfish is crushed in them,
shell and all.</p>

<p>Between you and me, I consider
that a very clever trick,
too. Don't you?</p>

<p>Summer is my favorite season
of the year. How I love the
green fields, the ripening grain,
the delicious fruits, for then the
Rabbits prick up their long ears,
and thinking themselves out of
danger, run along the hillside;
then the quails skulk in the
wheat stubble, and the birds hop
and fly about the whole day long.
I am very fond of Rabbits,
Quails, and other Birds. They
make a very satisfactory meal.
For dessert I have only to sneak
into an orchard and eat my fill
of apples, pears, and grapes.
You perceive I have very good
reason for liking the summer.
It's the merriest time of the year
for me, and my cubs. They
grow fat and saucy, too.</p>

<h2><a name="THE_GRAY_FOX" id="THE_GRAY_FOX"></a>THE GRAY FOX.</h2>

<div>
  <img class="drop-cap" src="images/initial_t.jpg" width="100" height="93"
    alt="" />
</div>
<p class="drop-cap">THE only Foxes that are hunted
(the others only being taken
by means of traps or poison)
are the Red and Gray species.
The Gray Fox is a more southern
species than the Red and is rarely
found north of the state of Maine.
Indeed it is said to be not common
anywhere in New England. In the
southern states, however, it wholly
replaces the Red Fox, and, according
to Hallock, one of the best authorities
on game animals in this country,
causes quite as much annoyance to the
farmer as does that proverbial and
predatory animal, the terror of the
hen-roost and the smaller rodents.
The Gray Fox is somewhat smaller
than the Red and differs from him in
being wholly dark gray "mixed hoary
and black." He also differs from his
northern cousin in being able to climb
trees. Although not much of a runner,
when hard pressed by the dog he will
often ascend the trunk of a leaning
tree, or will even climb an erect one,
grasping the trunk in his arms as
would a Bear. Nevertheless the Fox
is not at home among the branches,
and looks and no doubt feels very
much out of place while in this predicament.
The ability to climb, however,
often saves him from the hounds, who
are thus thrown off the scent and
Reynard is left to trot home at his
leisure.</p>

<p>Foxes live in holes of their own
making, generally in the loamy soil of
a side hill, says an old Fox hunter,
and the she-Fox bears four or five cubs
at a litter. When a fox-hole is discovered
by the Farmers they assemble
and proceed to dig out the inmates
who have lately, very likely, been
making havoc among the hen-roosts.
An amusing incident, he relates, which
came under his observation a few
years ago will bear relating. A farmer
discovered the lair of an old dog Fox
by means of his hound, who trailed
the animal to his hole. This Fox had
been making large and nightly inroads
into the poultry ranks of the neighborhood,
and had acquired great and
unenviable notoriety on that account.
The farmer and two companions,
armed with spades and hoes, and
accompanied by the faithful hound,
started to dig out the Fox. The hole
was situated on the sandy slope of a
hill, and after a laborious and continued
digging of four hours, Reynard
was unearthed and he and Rep, the
dog, were soon engaged in deadly
strife. The excitement had waxed
hot, and dog, men, and Fox were all
struggling in a promiscuous melee.
Soon a burly farmer watching his
chance strikes wildly with his hoe-handle
for Reynard's head, which is
scarcely distinguishable in the maze of
legs and bodies. The blow descends, but
alas! a sudden movement of the hairy
mass brings the fierce stroke upon
the faithful dog, who with a wild howl
relaxes his grasp and rolls with bruised
and bleeding head, faint and powerless
on the hillside. Reynard takes advantage
of the turn affairs have assumed,
and before the gun, which had been
laid aside on the grass some hours
before, can be reached he disappears
over the crest of the hill.</p>

<p>Hallock says that an old she-Fox
with young, to supply them with food,
will soon deplete the hen-roost and
destroy both old and great numbers of
very young chickens. They generally
travel by night, follow regular runs,
and are exceedingly shy of any invention
for their capture, and the use of
traps is almost futile. If caught in a
trap, they will gnaw off the captured
foot and escape, in which respect they
fully support their ancient reputation
for cunning.</p>

<h2><a name="MISCELLANY" id="MISCELLANY"></a>MISCELLANY.</h2>


<p><span class="sc">Rural Bird Life in India.</span>&mdash;"Nothing
gives more delight," writes
Mr. Caine, "in traveling through
rural India than the bird-life that
abounds everywhere; absolutely unmolested,
they are as tame as a poultry
yard, making the country one vast
aviary. Yellow-beaked Minas, Ring-doves,
Jays, Hoopoes, and Parrots take
dust baths with the merry Palm-squirrel
in the roadway, hardly
troubling themselves to hop out of the
way of the heavy bull-carts; every
wayside pond and lake is alive with
Ducks, Wild Geese, Flamingoes,
Pelicans, and waders of every size and
sort, from dainty red-legged beauties
the size of Pigeons up to the great
unwieldy Cranes and Adjutants five
feet high. We pass a dead Sheep with
two loathsome vultures picking over
the carcass, and presently a brood of
fluffy young Partridges with father
and mother in charge look at us fearlessly
within ten feet of our whirling
carriage. Every village has its flock
of sacred Peacocks pacing gravely
through the surrounding gardens and
fields, and Woodpeckers and Kingfishers
flash about like jewels in the
blazing sunlight."</p>

<hr class="w5" />

<p><span class="sc">Warning Colors.</span>&mdash;Very complete
experiments in support of the theory
of warning colors, first suggested by
Bates and also by Wallace, have been
made in India by Mr. Finn, says <i>The
Independent</i>. He concludes that there
is a general appetite for Butterflies
among insectivorous birds, though
they are rarely seen when wild to
attack them; also that many, probably
most birds, dislike, if not intensely,
at any rate in comparison with other
Butterflies, those of the Danais genus
and three other kinds, including a
species of Papilio, which is the most
distasteful. The mimics of these
Butterflies are relatively palatable. He
found that each bird has to separately
acquire its experience with bad-tasting
Butterflies, but well remembers what
it learns. He also experimented with
Lizards, and noticed that, unlike the
birds, they ate the nauseous as well as
other Butterflies.</p>

<hr class="w5" />

<p><span class="sc">Increase in Zoological Preserves
in the United States</span>&mdash;The
establishment of the National
Zoological Park, Washington, has led
to the formation of many other
zoological preserves in the United
States. In the western part of New
Hampshire is an area of 26,000 acres,
established by the late Austin Corbin,
and containing 74 Bison, 200 Moose,
1,500 Elk, 1,700 Deer of different
species, and 150 Wild Boar, all of
which are rapidly multiplying. In the
Adirondacks, a preserve of 9,000 acres
has been stocked with Elk, Virginia
Deer, Muledeer, Rabbits, and
Pheasants. The same animals are
preserved by W. C. Whitney on an
estate of 1,000 acres in the Berkshire
Hills, near Lenox, Mass., where also
he keeps Bison and Antelope. Other
preserves are Nehasane Park, in the
Adirondacks, 8,000 acres; Tranquillity
Park, near Allamuchy, N. J., 4,000
acres; the Alling preserve, near
Tacoma, Washington, 5,000 acres;
North Lodge, near St. Paul, Minn.,
400 acres; and Furlough Lodge, in
the Catskills, N. Y., 600 acres.</p>

<hr class="w5" />

<p><span class="sc">Robins Abundant</span>&mdash;Not for many
years have these birds been so numerous
as during 1898. Once, under some
wide-spreading willow trees, where
the ground was bare and soft, we
counted about forty Red-breasts feeding
together, and on several occasions
during the summer we saw so many in
flocks, that we could only guess at the
number. When unmolested, few
birds become so tame and none are
more interesting.</p>

<h2><a name="THE_GRAY_SQUIRREL" id="THE_GRAY_SQUIRREL"></a>THE GRAY SQUIRREL.</h2>

<div>
  <img class="drop-cap" src="images/initial_e.jpg" width="100" height="80"
    alt="" />
</div>
<p class="drop-cap">EAST of the Missouri River the
Gray Squirrel is found almost
everywhere, and is perhaps
the most common
variety. Wherever there is timber it
is almost sure to be met with, and in
many localities is very abundant, especially
where it has had an opportunity
to breed without unusual disturbance.
Its usual color is pale gray above and
white or yellowish white beneath, but
individuals of the species grade from
this color through all the stages to jet
black. Gray and black Squirrels are
often found associating together. They
are said to be in every respect alike, in
the anatomy of their bodies, habits,
and in every detail excepting the
color, and by many sportsmen they
are regarded as distinct species, and
that the black form is merely due to
melanism, an anomaly not uncommon
among animals. Whether this be the
correct explanation may well be left to
further scientific observation.</p>

<p>Like all the family, the Gray Squirrels
feed in the early morning just
after sunrise and remain during the
middle of the day in their hole or
nest. It is in the early morning or
the late afternoon, when they again
appear in search of the evening meal,
that the wise hunter lies in wait for
them. Then they may be heard and
seen playing and chattering together
till twilight. Sitting upright and
motionless on a log the intruder will
rarely be discovered by them, but at
the slightest movement they scamper
away, hardly to return. This fact is
taken advantage of by the sportsmen,
and, says an observer, be he at all
familiar with the runways of the
Squirrels at any particular locality he
may sit by the path and bag a goodly
number. Gray and Black Squirrels
generally breed twice during the spring
and summer, and have several young
at a litter. The young mature in
August and September.</p>

<p>We have been told that an incident
of migration of Squirrels of a very
remarkable kind occurred a good many
years ago, caused by lack of mast and
other food, in New York State. When
the creatures arrived at the Niagara
river, their apparent destination being
Canada, they seemed to hesitate before
attempting to cross the swift running
stream. The current is very rapid,
exceeding seven miles an hour. They
finally ventured in the water, however,
and with tails spread for sails,
succeeded in making the opposite
shore, but more than a mile below the
point of entrance. They are better
swimmers than one would fancy them
to be, as they have much strength and
endurance. We remember when a boy
seeing some mischievous urchins repeatedly
throw a tame Squirrel into deep
water for the cruel pleasure of watching
it swim ashore. The "sport" was soon
stopped, however, by a passerby, who
administered a rebuke that could
hardly be forgotten.</p>

<p>Squirrels are frequently domesticated
and become as tame as any
household tabby. Unfortunately Dogs
and Cats seem to show a relentless
enmity toward them, as they do toward
all rodents. The Squirrel is willing
to be friendly, and no doubt would
gladly affiliate with them, but the
instinct of the canine and the feline
impels them to exterminate it. We
once gave shelter and food to a strange
Cat and was rewarded by seeing it
fiercely attack and kill a beautiful
white Rabbit which until then had
had the run of the yard and never
before been molested. Until we shall
be able to teach the beasts of the field
something of our sentimental humanitarianism
we can scarcely expect to see
examples of cruelty wholly disappear.</p>

<h2><a name="THE_PECTORAL_SANDPIPER" id="THE_PECTORAL_SANDPIPER"></a>
  THE PECTORAL SANDPIPER.</h2>

<div>
  <img class="drop-cap" src="images/initial_m.jpg" width="100" height="69"
    alt="" />
</div>
<p class="drop-cap">MORE than a score of Sandpipers
are described in
the various works on
ornithology. The one
presented here, however,
is perhaps the most curious specimen,
distributed throughout North,
Central, and South America, breeding
in the Arctic regions. It is also of
frequent occurrence in Europe. Low,
wet lands, muddy flats, and the edges
of shallow pools of water are its favorite
resorts. The birds move in flocks, but,
while feeding, scatter as they move
about, picking and probing here and
there for their food, which consists of
worms, insects, small shell fish, tender
rootlets, and birds; "but at the report
of a gun," says Col. Goss, "or any
sudden fright, spring into the air,
utter a low whistling note, quickly
bunch together, flying swift and strong,
usually in a zigzag manner, and when
not much hunted often circle and drop
back within shot; for they are not
naturally a timid or suspicious bird,
and when quietly and slowly
approached, sometimes try to hide by
squatting close to the ground."</p>

<p>Of the Pectoral Sandpiper's nesting
habits, little has been known until
recently. From Mr. Nelson's interesting
description, in his report upon
"Natural History Collections in
Alaska," we quote as follows: "The
night of May 24, 1889, I lay wrapped
in my blanket, and from the raised
flap of the tent looked out over as
dreary a cloud-covered landscape as
can be imagined. As my eyelids
began to droop and the scene to become
indistinct, suddenly a low, hollow,
booming note struck my ear and sent
my thoughts back to a spring morning
in northern Illinois, and to the loud
vibrating tones of the Prairie Chickens.
[See <span class="sc">Birds and All Nature</span>, Vol.
IV, p. 18.] Again the sound arose,
nearer and more distinct, and with an
effort I brought myself back to the
reality of my position, and, resting
upon one elbow, listened. A few
seconds passed, and again arose the
note; a moment later I stood outside
the tent. The open flat extended away
on all sides, with apparently not a living
creature near. Once again the
note was repeated close by, and a
glance revealed its author. Standing
in the thin grass ten or fifteen yards
from me, with its throat inflated until
it was as large as the rest of the bird,
was a male Pectoral Sandpiper. The
succeeding days afforded opportunity
to observe the bird as it uttered its
singular notes, under a variety of
situations, and at various hours of the
day, or during the light Arctic night.
The note is deep, hollow, and resonant,
but at the same time liquid and
musical, and may be represented by a
repetition of the syllables <i>too-u</i>, <i>too-u</i>,
<i>too-u</i>, <i>too-u</i>, <i>too-u</i>." The bird may
frequently be seen running along the
ground close to the female, its enormous
sac inflated.</p>

<p>Mr. Murdock says the birds breed
in abundance at Point Barrow, Alaska,
and that the nest is always built in
the grass, with a preference for high
and dry localities. The nest was like
that of the other waders, a depression
in the ground, lined with a little dry
grass. The eggs are four, of pale
purplish-gray and light neutral tint.
It is sometimes called Grass Snipe.</p>

</div>
<p class="drop-cap">THE reason we know anything
at all is that various
forms of vibration are capable
of affecting our organs
of sense. These agitate the brain, the
mind perceives, and from perception
arise the higher forms of thought.
Perhaps the most important of the
senses is sight. It ranges in power
from the mere ability to perceive the
difference between light and darkness
up to a marvelous means of knowing
the nature of objects of various forms
and sizes, at both near and remote
range.</p>

<p>One the simplest forms of eyes is
found in the Sea-anemone. It has a
colored mass of pigment cells and
refractive bodies that break up the
light which falls upon them, and
it is able to know day and night. An
examination of this simple organ leads
one to think the scientist not far wrong
who claimed that the eye is a development
from what was once merely
a particular sore spot that was sensitive
to the action of light. The protophyte,
<i>Euglena varidis</i>, has what seems to be
the least complicated of all sense
organs in the transparent spot in the
front of its body.</p>

<p>We know that rays of light have
power to alter the color of certain
substances. The retina of the eye is
changed in color by exposure to continued
rays of light. Frogs in whose
eyes the color of the retina has
apparently been all changed by sunshine
are still able to take a fly accurately
and to recognize certain colors.</p>

<p>Whether the changes produced by
light upon the retina are all chemical
or all physical or partly both remains
open to discussion.</p>

<p>An interesting experiment was performed
by Professor Tyndall proving
that heat rays do not affect the eye
optically. He was operating along
the line of testing the power of the
eye to transmit to the sensorium the
presence of certain forms of radiant
energy. It is well known that certain
waves are unnoticed by the eye but
are registered distinctly by the photographic
plate, and he first showed
beyond doubt that heat waves as such
have no effect upon the retina. By
separating the light and heat rays from
an electric lantern and focusing the
latter, he brought their combined
energy to play where his own eye
could be placed directly in contact
with them, first protecting the exterior
of his eye from the heat rays. There
was no sensation whatever as a result,
but when, directly afterward, he
placed a sheet of platinum at the
convergence of the dark rays it quickly
became red hot with the energy which
his eye was unable to recognize.</p>

<p>The eye is a camera obscura with a
very imperfect lens and a receiving
plate irregularly sensitized; but it has
marvelous powers of quick adjustment.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[Pg 118]</a></span>
The habits of the animal
determine the character of the eye.
Birds of rapid flight and those which
scan the earth minutely from lofty
courses are able to adjust their vision
quickly to long and short range. The
eye of the Owl is subject to his will as
he swings noiselessly down upon the
Mouse in the grass. The nearer the
object the more the eye is protruded
and the deeper its form from front
to rear.</p>

<p>The human eye adjusts its power
well for small objects within a few
inches and readily reaches out for those
several miles away. A curious feature
is that we are able to adjust the eye
for something at long range in less
time than for something close at hand.
If we are reading and someone calls
our attention to an object on the
distant hillside, the eye adjusts itself
to the distance in less than a second,
but when we return our vision to the
printed page several seconds are
consumed in the re-adjustment.</p>

<p>The Condor of the Andes has great
powers of sight. He wheels in beautiful
curves high in the air scrutinizing
the ground most carefully and all the
time apparently keeping track of all
the other Condors within a range of
several miles. No sooner does one of
his kind descend to the earth than those
near him shoot for the same spot hoping
the find may be large enough for a
dinner party. Others soaring at greater
distances note their departure and follow
in great numbers so that when the
carcass discovered by one Condor
proves to be a large one, hundreds of
these huge birds congregate to enjoy
the feast. The Condor's eyes have
been well compared to opera glasses,
their extension and contraction are
so great.</p>

<p>The Eagle soars towards the sun
with fixed gaze and apparent fullness
of enjoyment. This would ruin his
sight were it not for the fact that he
and all other birds are provided with
an extra inner eyelid called the nictitating
membrane which may be drawn
at will over the eye to protect it from
too strong a light. Cuvier made the
discovery that the eye of the Eagle,
which had up to his time been supposed
of peculiarly great strength to enable
it to feast upon the sun's rays, is closed
during its great flights just as the eye
of the barnyard fowl is occasionally
rested by the use of this delicate semi-transparent
membrane. Several of
the mammals, among them being the
horse, are equipped with such an inner
eyelid.</p>

<p>One of my most striking experiences
on the ocean was had when I
pulled in my first Flounder and found
both of his eyes on the same side of
his head. All Flat-fish are similarly
equipped. On the side which glides
over the bottom of the sea, the Halibut,
Turbot, Plaice, and Sole are
almost white, the upper side being
dark enough to be scarcely distinguishable
from the ground. On the upper
side are the two eyes, while the lower
side is blind.</p>

<p>When first born the fish swims upright
with a slight tendency to favor
one side; its eyes are on opposite sides
of the head, as in most vertebrates
and the head itself is regular. With
age and experience in exploring the
bottom on one side, the under eye
refuses to remain away from the light
and gradually turns upward, bringing
with it the bones of the skull to such
an extent that the adult Flat-fish
becomes the apparently deformed
creature that appears in our markets
as a regular product of the deep.</p>

<p>The eyeless inhabitant of the
streams in Mammoth Cave presents a
curious instance of the total loss of a
sense which remains unused. These
little fishes are not only without sight
but are also almost destitute of color
and markings, the general appearance
being much like that of a fish with
the skin taken off for the frying pan.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[Pg 119]</a></span>
The eyes of fishes generally are so
nearly round that they may be used
with good effect as simple microscopes
and have considerable magnifying
power. Being continually washed
with the element in which they move,
they have no need for winking and
the lachrymal duct which supplies
tears to the eyes of most of the animal
kingdom is entirely wanting. Whales
have no tear glands in their eyes, and
the whole order of Cetacea are tearless.</p>

<p>Among domestic animals there is
considerable variety of structure in the
eye. The pupil is usually round, but
in the small Cats it is long vertically,
and in the Sheep, in fact, in all the
cud chewers and many other grass
eaters, the pupil is long horizontally.</p>

<p>Insects present a wonderful array of
eyes. These are not movable, but
the evident purpose is that there shall
be an eye in readiness in whatever
direction the insect may have business.
The common Ant has fifty six-cornered
jewels set advantageously in his little
head and so arranged as to take in
everything that pertains to the pleasure
of the industrious little creature. As
the Ant does not move about with great
rapidity he is less in need of many
eyes than the House-fly which calls
into play four thousand brilliant facets,
while the Butterfly is supplied with
about seventeen thousand. The most
remarkable of all is the blundering
Beetle which bangs his head against
the wall with twenty-five thousand
eyes wide open.</p>
